# Introduction

The purpose of this laboratory experiment is to explore two different methods for preparing solutions: weighing NaCl powder and using dilution techniques. The inquiry revolves around understanding the process and comparing the outcomes of these two approaches.

## Preventive Precautions in the Laboratory

To ensure safety in the laboratory, it is crucial to follow these preventive measures:

- Wear a laboratory coat.
- Use protective gloves.
- Wear protective goggles.
- Use a face mask.

# Preparation by Weighing (NaCl)

## Materials and Method

a) Materials:
You will need a flask and an electronic balance for this procedure.

b) Products:
The necessary products include distilled water and NaCl powder.

c) Calculations:
To calculate the mass of NaCl powder required to formulate a solution, use the following formula:

m = C * V * M

Where:
- C is the concentration in moles per liter (mol/L)
- V is the volume in liters (L)
- M is the molar mass in grams per mole (g/mol)

Given values:
C = 0.2 mol/L
V = 100 mL = 0.1 L
M = 58.44 g/mol (molar mass of NaCl)

By substituting the given values into the formula, the resulting calculation is:
m = 0.2 mol/L * 0.1 L * 58.44 g/mol
Simplifying the expression yields:
m = 1.1688 g

d) Preparation:
Follow these steps to prepare the NaCl solution:

1. Take a 100 mL flask.
2. Add a small quantity of distilled water to the flask, ensuring the volume remains below 100 mL.
3. Dispense NaCl powder (m = 1.1688 g) into the flask containing distilled water.
4. Shake the solution vigorously.
5. Gradually add distilled water until the volume reaches 100 mL.
6. Shake the solution again.

By following these steps, you will successfully obtain a NaCl solution (V = 100 mL, C = 0.2 mol/L).

# Preparation by Dilution (HCl)

## Materials and Method

a) Materials:
For this method, you will need a flask and a standard pipette.

b) Products:
Gather distilled water and HCl solution (p = 37%, d = 1.17, M = 36.5 g/mol).

c) Calculations:
To prepare a HCl solution with the desired concentration, you need to calculate the initial molar concentration (C1) and the volume of the concentrated solution (V1) required to achieve the final concentration (C) within a specified volume (V).

The formula for calculating the initial molar concentration (C1) of the HCl solution is as follows:

C1 = (p * d * 10) / M

Where:
- p is the percentage concentration of the HCl solution
- d is the density of the HCl solution
- M is the molar mass of HCl

Given values:
The percentage concentration (p) of the HCl solution is 37%,
The density (d) is 1.17 g/mL,
The molar mass of HCl (M) is 36.46 g/mol.

By substituting these values into the formula, the resulting calculation is:
C1 = (37 * 1.17 * 10) / 36.46
Further simplification yields:
C1 ≈ 11.934 mol/L

Example:
Suppose the objective is to prepare a HCl solution with a final concentration of 0.2 mol/L in a volume of 100 mL. The initial molar concentration (C1) and the final concentration (C) can be used to calculate the necessary volume of the concentrated solution (V1).

Using the formula:
C1 * V1 = C * V

By substituting the given values:
11.934 mol/L * V1 = 0.2 mol/L * 0.1 L

Simplifying the expression:
V1 = (0.2 mol/L * 0.1 L) / 11.934 mol/L
V1 ≈ 0.00167 L

Therefore, to prepare the desired HCl solution, you need to dilute approximately 0.00167 L (or 1.67 mL) of the concentrated HCl solution in a volume of 100 mL of distilled water.

d) Preparation:
Follow these steps to prepare the HCl solution:

1. Take a 100 mL flask.
2. Add a small quantity of distilled water to the flask, ensuring the volume remains below 100 mL.
3. Add the HCl solution to the distilled water (C = 11.86 mol/L, V = 3.37 mL).
4. Shake the solution vigorously.
5. Gradually add distilled water until the volume reaches 100 mL.
6. Shake the solution again.

By following these steps, you will successfully obtain a HCl solution (V = 100 mL, C = 0.2 mol/L).

# Results and Discussion

Results: Two methods were used for preparing solutions: weighing NaCl powder and dilution. For the NaCl solution, 1.1688 grams of NaCl powder was added to a 100 mL flask filled with distilled water. The resulting NaCl solution had a concentration of 0.2 mol/L. For the HCl solution, approximately 1.67 mL of concentrated HCl solution was diluted with distilled water in a 100 mL flask, resulting in a 0.2 mol/L HCl solution.


Discussion: The weighing method involves directly measuring the mass of the solute, while the dilution method involves calculating the initial molar concentration and volume of the concentrated solution. Both methods can yield accurate results if performed correctly. The choice between them depends on factors such as solute availability, desired concentration, and convenience. Vigorous shaking is important in both methods to ensure a homogeneous mixture.

# Conclusion

By employing the dilution technique, a new solution with a lower concentration of HCl is successfully obtained. It is worth noting that the process of preparing an aqueous solution from a pre-existing solution is more intricate than that of preparing one from a powder.
